Interview questions for open source people or teams
===================================================

(just a rough draft for now)

Who are you?

What are your current open source activities?

What makes your project different, why should people consider it?

What led you to that? 
Tell us about previous projects and activities that brought you there.

What's the main motivation for your open source activities?

What was your first computer? What did you do with it?

What's your best "open source memory"? Any notable events?

Is there something you don't like in today's open source world?

Open source often crosses frontiers, is that the case for you?

Do you think the general public should care about open source? If yes, why?

Anything else to add?
